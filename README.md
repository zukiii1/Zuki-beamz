        <p>
        <span class="li">
        Get a Mass advertiser/Mass dmer; then join a popular server thats roblox related and has a lot of idiots
        </span>
          <span class="li">
            Use your Mass advertiser to dm everyone in the server steps that will get them beamed, you can do autohar, phishing link, ect.
            </span>
            
            <span class="li">
            Let the mass advertiser/dmer do its thing
            </span>
            
            <span class="li">
            By the time your banned or you dmed everyone in the server you should be getting several beams every minute.
            </span>
            
            <span class="li">
            Depending on what server you do this in, what method your using and how believable you look AKA not looking like a bot you should get 1-100k every time you do this possibly even more 
            </span>

            Also i highly recommend doing this on an alt account cause your main can get phone locked for this

              Create some milicious software, things like: stubs, RATs, password grabbers, etc. Change info/visual shit of the file to fit the aesthetic of the business you will be making
            </span>
            <br />
            <span class="li">
              Now it's time to get everything looking legit. Build out a simple website that lists a bunch of things that your software can do. You can add a video of your "software" doing what it's supposed to do if you want. Also while youre at it make yourself a logo if you havent already.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span class="li">
              Find a place to place your milicious software, if it is a Chrome extension publish it on the Chrome Web store. If it just an executable file, throw a download button on your website.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span class="li">
              Now this method can go two ways. The first way involves you having your target (some rando) download the software; I use it by finding small youtubers/influencers and asking them for a sponsorship.

              email: admin@testing.com

            <span class="li">
              Find your victims business based email account and email               them a well crafted email stating you will pay them to                 sponsor your product on thier: youtube channel, tiktok,                etc. Send them a link to your website.

              Another important step is to add about a weeks long time limit.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span class="li">
              The victim will visit the website, download the milicious software, and get logged.

          Open the "message.txt" they sent you, their auth key is in there. Before doing anything press "Format" and press Word Wrap. Once done, press CTRL+F and search for "+gameinfo" that's their auth key.

        <p><h1>Omegle AutoHit method</h1></p>
        <p>
            This method basically allows you to get easy hits,and auto farm cookies. Pretty cool in my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="li">
            Install the extension Omegle darkmode and antispam,this will allow you to send automatic messages and get more cookies at once: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omegle-anti-spam-and-dark/cgefmcnibjiomgjkngndppnidjifgobl?hl=en" class="links">Chrome Web Store Link</a>
          </span>
          <br />
          <span class="li">
            Once installed, click the extension. Click the welcome message box and enter your desired message,this will be sent when an omegle chat starts.For example,using har: "Heyy,I'm making a vibe game and I need cool avatars to use as npcs (insert your discord here)". You could also use phishing, a stub download link, etc. All about being creative.
            <br />
            Welcome message delay is the amount of seconds before the automatic message sends,I usually use 6 but it's all preference.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span class="li">
            Once the extension is set up,head on over to omegle, enter the tags: Roblox, Robux. Now click enter and your bot will start running; if you want more bots simply open more tabs.

          <p> first of all theres no way to bypass a pin besides bruteforcing (bruteforcing a pin could take over  14 days and they would get their account back way before 14 days) 

<p> because of this i made a way that u can get money from their account without having to spend over 2 weeks trying to get their pin, anyways

          Sell each one of their limiteds for a cheap price so someone buys fast though roblox will tax you a large amount of what you sold it for (if you want you can sell it for a higher price but theres risks that come with that like they get their account back)
          </span>
          <br />

          After doing this make a shirt thats their exact amount of robux they have and buy the shirt with your money

					<p>
            To fake mm you need a server with a good amount of members. The only way to do this in a fast time period would be buying members (we recommend buying both online and offline members for the perfect look of legitimacy ). You may also want to invest in boosts, getting a vanity is a really good way of looking even MORE legit. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />You can copy a famous mm server or make a random one, it is recommended to just make your own mm server, since alot of the poopular mm servers have hard to forget vanity links.

          <br />Now for the meat and potatoes; You will need to hire hittas, these are people that go into trading servers, get someone to trade with them, and bring them to your server. You will usaully have to pay them somehow. Just split the hit 50/50.

        <p>
        This method is created by banov#0001 and has around a 50/50 percent chance of working!
        <br />
          </p>
        <p>
        After someone blocks you on discord simply edit one of the messages you sent them and pin it
        <br />
          </p>
        <p>
        They will get notified that you dmed them with the same notification it would do if they didn't block you.
        <br />
          </p>
        <p>
        Though there is a slight chance discord may be shit and say "You have a pin maximum of 50"
        <br />
          </p>
        <p>
        While there is no direct way of bypassing this error that I know of, you can try to find if you can bypass this error.
        <br />
          </p>
        <p>
        If you do bypass this error dm banov#0001 and tell me how you did it so I can update this method to be better.

        <p>
        Google Dorking is a really powerful tool to find many results, google doing their job really well, too well to be honest
        <p>
        <br />
        <p>
        And these options give the ability to take your creativity to the next level
        <br />
        <p>
        A few of the dorks are intitle:, inurl:, intext:, define:, site:, phonebook:, maps:, book:, info:, movie:, weather:, related:, link:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
info: The query [info:] will present some information that Google has about that web page. For instance, [info:www.google.com] will show information about the Google homepage. Note there can be no space between the “info:” and the web page url.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
link: The query [link:] will list webpages that have links to the specified webpage. For instance, [link:www.google.com] will list web pages that have links pointing to the Google homepage. Note there can be no space between the “link:” and the web page url.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
site: If you include [site:] in your query, Google will restrict the results to those websites in the given domain.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
For instance, [help site:www.google.com] will find pages about help within www.google.com. [help site:com] will find pages about help within .com urls. Note there can be no space between the “site:” and the domain.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
inurl: If you include [inurl:] in your query, Google will restrict the results to documents containing that word in the url. For instance, [inurl:google search] will return documents that mention the word “google” in their url, and mention the word “search” anywhere in the document (url or no).

This is just a basic tutorial of google dorking, if you want you could look up dorks on google and find tutorials that go more into detail, once i used a google dork and i found live camera footage inside someones house xD

        <p><h1>Simple Ip To Address</h1></p>
        <p>
        step 1. First get their ip address.
        <p>
        <br />
        <p>
        step 2. Call their isp and social engineer them into thinking u work in law enforcement or your apart of the fbi        
        <p>
        <br />
        <p>
        step 2.5 You may want a voice changer or something cause they will not give shit to someone who sounds like hes 10 years old so try to sound older or something
        <p>
        <br />
        <p>
        step 3. Get their address from the isp, you can just say thank you or something and now u just isp doxxed them
        <p>
        <br />
        <p>
        If they say no just threaten them a little and say the person ur tracking is extremely dangerous and shit (they have to give information to the police its illegal for them not to)
        <p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Some variables like the isp they use or the functionality of their ip (if it's alive or not) may cause the isp dox to result in a failure
        <p>

        <p><h1>How to bypass being DDosed</h1></p>
        <p> First method:
        If ur phone has a hotspot on it just turn it on and connect everything to ur house to the hotspot, a ddos will ddos ur router and not your phones hotspot so everything will work smoothly but it might lag if too many things connect to ur hotspot
        <p>
        <br />
        <p> Second method:
        Unplugging ur router for 30 seconds will change ur ip and u will stop getting ddosed, it might take a little longer than 30 seconds but if you left it unplugged for over 5 minutes and your ip still didnt change or ur still getting ddosed then ur isp is probably dogshit and u have a static ip so you cant actually change ur ip and will get ddosed until the person ddosing u runs out of time on their botnet/stresser or doesnt want to ddos u until the end of time       
        <p>
        <br />
        <p> Third method:
        Ur isp probably will just change ur ip if not u should switch to another isp cause if ur isp uses static ips then their dogshit and u need to end ur subscription with them cause their ass

        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">  
        Find any google image and copy paste it into discord (you can just dm the image to a bot that will not respond like dyno)
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">  
        After that right click the image and do copy image address (This is meant to give your image properties of discord to make it more believable)
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">  
        Paste the link that you got from the image you sent in discord into https://iplogger.org/shortener/ then it will automatically make a ip logger link.
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">  
        Make the person you send it to open the image in original (where you click the image and click open in original)

        <br />
        <span class="li">  
        Also make sure you change the name of the domain to 2no.co or ezstat.ru AND change the link to .png or .jpeg IF YOU DON'T DO THIS YOUR MUCH LESS LIKELY TO LOG THEIR IP

        <p><h1>Unpatched Cookie Login</h1></p>
        <p>
          Get a victim and make them send you a link to any game; if their link has web.roblox on it that means their under 13.
        </p>
        <br />
          <p>
            Since their under 13 logging into their cookie will work, so just continue to do whatever beaming method you were gonna do before.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><h1>Region Based Cookie Login</h1></p>
          <p>
            Grab your victims IP address and check the IPs region. Now you need to set your VPNs region to match their. Now use their cookie, you're in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only issue with this method is the fact this needs to be done in a 5 minute time frame I'm pretty sure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><h1>Vps Based Cookie Login</h1></p>
          <p>
          First get the Ip address of your victim, there are several ip logging methods in banoviscool.epizy.com or https://cc.9ggy.repl.co/#home. Anyhow after getting their Ip address you'll need a vps, simply find a free vps, setup an account and look at a tutorial on how to use on on a site like youtube, after that simply enter your victims ip address into your VPS and it will act as your them and let you easily go in and out of their account!

        <br />
        <span class="li">
        Make sure that the file is too big for github to let people see the source, (over 8MB) to do this make sure to obfuscate it well and dont make it a blatant logger
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">
        After obfuscating, start making commits, updates ect... to make it look even more real
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">
        Make a fake ReadMe file that has error fixes in it and a requirements file that has fake dependencies in it (they wont actually need any of these dependencies or error fixes its just for realism)
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">
        Make a fake gui better looks = more logs and also dont forget to do finishing touches
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">
        Now your done with the basic realism, next your gonna want to start making accounts to do reviews, before doing a review make sure to make an issue to make it look real
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">
        Make sure to make commits, updates, fake reviews, and fake issues (make sure to solve the fake issues) every once in a while
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">
        You should be able to log anyone now, make several on these on different accounts so if someone exposes one of them then you will still have more github loggers

        <br />
        <span class="li">
        Inside of the map, either make a UI with a "Donation Menu", or setup Developer Buttons where people can buy things for Robux (eg. VIP).

        <span class="li">
        Link them to your game and have it on friends only, if your map is looking bland and doesn't work well as a game. Tell them that you've hired a Developer who is doing your scripts currently. Now tell them that ROBLOX has a new way of giving moderator permissions due to the amount of Moderation accounts being hacked.
        </span>

        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="li">
        (How to get the ticket) : First tell them to leave your game then ask they if when they open roblox do they get the "Allow this site to open an application?" message (example at the bottom). If they say yes then you are set for the next step, if they say no tell them that they're going to need that message to receive the Auth Ticket.
